### 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## About Me

🌟 I'm a passionate developer with a deep love for coding and computer science. My journey in the world of technology has been an exciting one, and I'm always eager to explore new possibilities.

🎮 When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you can often find me enjoying my favorite games. Video games have been a source of inspiration and relaxation for me, and they often spark my creativity.

🛠️ Currently, I contribute as a developer to the open-source software (OSS) development studio, BCC. You can check out our projects on [BCC GitHub](https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty).
