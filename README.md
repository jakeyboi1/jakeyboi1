### Howdy welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

## A little about me.
- I like RedM. Used to play it quite alot, do not really play anymore. However I still enjoy making scripts, and maps for the community to enjoy in my spare time.
- I started learning to develop RedM about 4 months ago as of writing. I only "know" LUA at the moment, and am by no means a "professional developer" this is simply a hobyy.
- I just make these as a hobby too provide something useful or at the very least fun for the community.

## How to contact me?
- Opening issues and pull request on here.
- The VORP discord is a great place. https://discord.gg/DmE8uy5xZv
