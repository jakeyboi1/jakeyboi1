# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!

Iâ€™m a software developer with experience in a variety of programming languages. I love learning new languages and technologies, and luckily I learn pretty quickly. My coding journey started with **RedM**, where I spent several years developing scripts as part of a group called **[BCC](https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty)**. Those years taught me a lot and shaped the way I approach development today.

Since then, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills and interests into several areas of software development, and my current coding hobbies include:

- **Game Hacking & Reverse Engineering**: Exploring how games work behind the scenes, and making mods for them.
- **Web Development**: Creating web pages for personal projects.
- **Visual Basic**: Required by college, but still a learning experience!

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects!
