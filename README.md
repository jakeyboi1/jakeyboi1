### Howdy welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

## A little about me.
- I like RedM. Used to play it quite alot, not so much anymore. However I still enjoy making scripts, and maps for the community to enjoy in my spare time.
- I started learning to develop RedM about 4 months ago as of writing. I only "know" LUA at the moment, and am by no means a "professional developer" this is simply a hobyy.
- I do not charge for anything I make as I just want to help the community. Provide something useful or at the very least fun for the community.

## How to contact me?
- Opening issues and pull request on here.
- The VORP discord is a great place. https://discord.gg/DmE8uy5xZv
- I have also created a new discord specifically for scripts, and maps I have made. Mainly for me too keep track of what I have done, but also a way for me to more easily find and see issues or suggestions people make for my scripts. https://discord.gg/XubeuG3H9F
