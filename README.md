### Howdy welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

## A little about me.
- I like RedM. Used to play it quite alot, do not really play anymore. However I still enjoy making scripts, and maps for the community to enjoy in my spare time.
- I started learning to develop RedM about 8 months ago as of writing
- I just make these as a hobby too provide something useful or at the very least fun for the community.
- I am a developer for the OSS development studio BCC https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty

## How to contact me?
- Opening issues and pull request on here.
- The BCC discord is also a great place https://discord.gg/bNDpwruqwX
